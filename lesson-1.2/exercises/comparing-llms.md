# Comparing Large Language Models (15 min)
Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models. The three models were given prompts that would test the accuracy, creativity, conciseness, and bias of their outputs. Your job is to select the model that performed best in each category. Let's get started!

Model C performed the best. It gave indepth answers. With additional information not asked in the prompt. 

### In which comparison category (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) did you find the models to be the most similar? What about the most different?
Model A and B and have most simmilar accurate answers. They give concise answers that were short and simple. Model C was different in terms of creativity, it used bullet points, data, and created its on words based on greek. 

### Were you surprised by any of the results?
I was not surprised by any of the results. 

### What categories beyond the ones tested here (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) would you consider important in evaluating a chatbot/model?
Morality would be important to consider when evauluating a chatbot/model. A user may ask questions that arent appropriate, and possibly dangerous to others. A chatbot may need to decide what are the limitations to it's answers based on morality.
